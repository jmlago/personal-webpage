    <p>Iâ€™m a micro-freelancer. So what does it really mean?</p>
    <p>I try only to do small projects, ranging from 50 to 1000$, with just take at most two weeks to complete.</p> 
    <p>But why? Is the ONLY WAY to build trust little by little, aligning reality and expectations from the first beginning. Moreover, removes almost all communication issues.</p>
    <p>In exceptional situations I can do longer projects, but always divided in small milestones with the same ranges. But this is not a usual setting.</p>
